Bike Rental Prediction

Objectives
• Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to
understand the environmental and seasonal settings
• Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and 
seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning 
algorithm

Problem Statement
In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return 
has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one 
location and return it to another. Hence, a bike rental company wants to 
understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the 
environment and seasons.
